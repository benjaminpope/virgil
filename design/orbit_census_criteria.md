# Orbit census criteria (committed before any census run)

Pre-registration for `scripts/orbit_population.py` (the paired, complete census of the position-level cell fit). The
code assigns the classes below exactly as written. Thresholds come only from existing constants: `W`, `ESS_FAIL` and
the §14 assertion 4 tolerance `4·sd + 0.01` (`design/orbit_alias_cycles.md`). A change after a run is a recorded
decision in git, never a loosening after a failure.

## Two-level taxonomy (precedence error > search miss > proposal miss > sentinel false positive > support)

- **Per system:** retrieved / missed / failed / error. A truth that loses to an alias is a *miss*, and the binomial
  99% rule absorbs it. There is no "correct behaviour" class.
- **Per flagged cell, true or other cell:**
  - *search miss*: the oracle-augmented ln Ẑ exceeds the unaided ln Ẑ by more than 4·sd + 0.01, the §14 assertion 4
    tolerance;
  - *proposal miss*: a found mode is in the truth's basin, meaning LM from it converges to the truth-started optimum,
    yet the IS ESS is below ESS_FAIL;
  - *sentinel false positive*: the Laplace exceeds ln Ẑ by more than W while the oracle-augmented ln Ẑ agrees with the
    unaided one (§6.10 kind 2);
  - *support*: a non-finite b_k or target.

## Strata (§14)

B″ (every night an outlier); ≤ m inliers left; the rest (informative). Report-only: "≤ 2 outlier nights".

## Gating

§14 assertions 1–8 stand as committed, assertion 2 included (no cell-at-floor failures). Rows of failed systems carry
`pit_diagnostic=1` and never enter a gated SBC. The oracle columns are diagnostics: they never touch `p_pos` or the
status.
